# TGV-feeding-respiration-rate
Laboratory experiment conducted Nov-Dec 2023
Testing whether maternal pathogen exposure alters offspring feeding rate and respiration rate in early life
Experimental set up: 2 Maternal pathogen exposure treatments, given on maternal days 2-4: O.pajunii or pathogen free placebo
subjects: 80 S genotype D. dentifera total. (40 per maternal pathogen treatment). Collected at 0-24hrs of age.
Data collected: feeding rates: day 1(24hrs), day 8 (6 hours), and day 16(6 hours)
                respiration rates: day 8 (2hrs), day 16 (2hrs)
